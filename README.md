# Word on the SWEet

## Setup

Run `npm init` and `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Running the Game

To run the game locally, navigate to `multiplayer-game-server-7/wobsite` and run `yarn start`. Open the game in the appropriate localhost port.

To deploy the game to multiple users, make an account on ngrok.com, run the ngrok.exe file, then do ngrok http [port] after you `npm start` your webapp. It will give you a link for sharing.

## Running Tests

To run unit tests, navigate to the `multiplayer-game-server-7/wobsite` directory and run `npm test`.

Additionally, we had a group of dedicated beta testers rigorously test our program:
Samuel Ferraro, Jacob Hirschhorn, and Austin Funk
